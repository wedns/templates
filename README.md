# Code templates

A small collection of code templates for problem sets and simple projects.

Each template has its own README.md explaining it in more details.

Heavily inspired by
[Kay Lack's Toy C](https://github.com/neoeno/toy-c-project-template) and pairs
well with [new](https://github.com/wedns/scripts/blob/main/new).
